# GEOG5003 - Assignment 2
This is a Cellular Model used to simulate a site suitability analysis process to identify possible suitable location for constructing a factory that makes rock aggregate somewhere in the UK.

The Model Design Process include:

> 1)	Creteria Selection - Geology, Transport and Population
> 2)	Layer Normalization - Setting datasets to the same scale e.g. 0 to 255.
> 3)	Weighted Overlay - Combining the three layers

The model works by taking in the input files which represent the criterions used to model the suitability analysis. This is aided by a python class which provides a mechanism for reading external data into the model. The Jupyter Notebook file which contains the model implementation, will then instantiate the data class to read the data and build an interactive graphical user interface

__Project Structure:__

> * .gitattributes - gives attributes to pathnames in the model.
> * Data.py - a class used to read data into the model.
> * GEOG5003_Assignment_two.ipynb - the main model file.
> * Geology.txt - represents the geology criteria used to build the suitability analysis.
> * LICENSE - repository license permiting open source capablities for its use, change and distribution by other users.
> * Model Documentation.docx - contains information on the model execution procedures.
> * Pop.txt - represents the population criteria used to build the suitability analysis. 
> * README.md - description of project structure and functionality.
> * Transport.txt - represents the transport criteria used to build the suitability analysis. 
> * weighted_overlay.txt - a list containing weighted pixels from the three layers at every site.
> * weihted_overlay.png - an output image of weighted pixels.
> * pycache - a directory automatically generated by python that contains cache files

__Running the Model:__

The model results into a __Graphical User Interface (GUI)__ with a __Header__ showing the title of the widget, __Sliders__ representing the weights of inputs for suitability model, and a __Run Model__ button the executes the model upon adjusting the input weights on the sliders.
