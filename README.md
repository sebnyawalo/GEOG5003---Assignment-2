# GEOG5003 - Assignment 2
This is a Cellular Model used to simulate a site suitability analysis process to identify possible suitable location for constructing a factory that makes rock aggregate somewhere in the UK.

The Model Design Process include:

> 1)	Creteria Selection - Geology, Transport and Population
> 2)	Layer Normalization - Setting datasets to the same scale e.g. 0 to 255.
> 3)	Weighted Overlay - Combining the three layers

The model works by taking in the input files which represent the criterions used to model the suitability analysis. This is aided by a python class which provides a mechanism for reading external data into the model. The Jupyter Notebook file which contains the model implementation, will then instantiate the data class to read the data and build an interactive graphical user interface

__Project Structure:__

> * Agent Framework.py  - this is agent class which defines the agents behaviours through move, eat and share data methods.
> * Model.py - defines the model  and  its functions for executing different components of the model.
> * .gitattributes - gives attributes to pathnames in the model.
> * Capture.PNG - A sample screenshot of an animated canvas resulting from the agents interactions.
> * LICENSE - repository license permiting open source capablities for its use, change and distribution by other users
> * README.md - description of project structure and functionality
> * environment.output.txt - a 2D list respresenting the agents interaction space
> * in.txt - contains raster data with values equivalent to image pixels
> * pycache - a directory automatically generated by python that contains cache files

__Running the Model:__

To run the model, execute model.py from console. Once the file has loaded, enter the values of the number of agents, the number of iterations and the number of Neighbourâ€™s.

Once the model has been executed, it will display a GUI. From the __File__ menu, click __Run Model__.
This will display an animated canvas as shown below.
